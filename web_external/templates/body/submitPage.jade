    To submit to this phase of the challenge, upload your output files here. The
    output files must map one-to-one to each file from the input dataset. Your
    files may have different file extensions, but otherwise the names should match
    each corresponding input file.

    Use the button below to select all of the files, or drag and drop them onto
    the button. If the selection is valid, you can upload them. Once done, your
    submission is complete and your result will be scored. When the scoring is
